Task Description:

This code task involves constructing a binary search tree (BST) from a given set of data and building a min-heap using two different methods: insert and build Heap.

Objective:

The objective of this task is to demonstrate the understanding of BST and min-heap data structures and their construction algorithms.

Code Overview:

The code consists of the following components:

- TreeNode class: represents a node in the BST
- MinHeap class: represents a min-heap
- add function: inserts a node into the BST
- postOrder function: performs post-order traversal of the BST
- preOrder function: performs pre-order traversal of the BST
- populateTree function: constructs the BST from the given data
- main function: contains the program's entry point and demonstrates the usage of the above components.
  

Binary Search Tree (BST) Features:

1. Node Insertion: The code allows inserting nodes into the BST with a given value.
2. Post-Order Traversal: The code performs a post-order traversal of the BST, printing the values in the correct order.
3. Pre-Order Traversal: The code performs a pre-order traversal of the BST, printing the values in the correct order.
4. BST Construction: The code constructs the BST from a given set of data.

Min-Heap Features:

1. Insert Method: The code builds a min-heap using the insert method, inserting values one by one.
2. BuildHeap Method: The code builds a min-heap using the buildHeap method, building the heap from a given set of data.
3. Min-Heap Printing: The code prints the min-heap values using both methods.
